Note: If you have updated FireFox since May 2017, or if Chromium is your primary browser, these steps are unnecesary for watching Netflix. But, it's still a good idea to install Pepperflash so you can watch flash videos from sites other than Netflix

To watch Flash videos with <u>Firefox</u>, <u>Chromium</u>, and <u>Opera</u>, we recommend using <u>Pepperflash</u>, rather than <u>Adobe Flash</u>, for security reasons.  <u>Pepperflash</u> is maintained by Google and included in the <u>Chrome</u> browser by default, and can be downloaded separately to be used in other browsers.  Please run this command to install <u>Pepperflash</u>:

```
sudo apt install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
```

To install Google <u>Chrome</u>, follow these instructions:

### Download Chrome

First, you'll need to download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Click the **Download Now** button:

Select the **64-bit .deb (For Debian/Ubuntu)** option, then click **Accept and Install**.

### Install Chrome

After the download is complete, <u>Ubuntu Software Center</u> will open automatically. Click on the **Install** button:

When prompted, enter your password and wait for the installation to finish. When it's complete, the **Install** button will say **Reinstall** instead:

If the <u>Software Center</u> isn't working, re-download <u>Chrome</u> and choose **Save File** to the `Downloads` folder, and then run this command:

```
sudo apt install ~/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

### Run Chrome

Click on the Ubuntu (<i class="fl-ubuntu"></i>) button in the upper left to open the Dash, then search for <u>Chrome</u>:

<small>* You may need to log out and in for <u>Chrome</u> to appear in the Dash.</small>

You can click on <u>Chrome</u> here to run it. For easy access, you can drag the item to the Launcher on the left:

![Locking Chrome to the Launcher](/images/flash/step7.png)

<u>Chrome</u> will be locked to your Launcher so that you can click on it at any time:

<u>Chrome</u> will automatically be updated through the <u>Ubuntu Software Center</u>.
